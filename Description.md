# Evaluation of clouds simulated by GCMs based on a process oriented analysis using A-train instantaneous satellite observations #

> The multi-sensors A-train observations allow to make the correlation between the different cloud variables at the instantaneous time scale, and at high resolution (CALIPSO-GOCCP and MODIS, PARASOL). This allows to see how different key cloud properties (cloud fraction, cloud vertical distribution provided from CALIPSO and cloud reflectance measured by MODIS and PARASOL which is a good surrogate of the cloud optical depth) vary one as a function of the other and build pictures of cloud processes well suited for the evaluation of clouds in climate models. The COSP simulator allows to provide a description of the clouds simulated by the models that is consistent with these satellite observations and to build the same pictures from the models outputs and the simulator tools. The use of instantaneous joint observations facilitates the link between observations relationship and parameterization in the models.

> The following figures describe the instantaneous relationship between the cloud cover, the cloud vertical distribution and the cloud reflectance observed and simulated from LMDZ5B and COSP simulator.

**Figure 1:** 2D histograms of instantaneous cloud reflectance and cloud fraction a) observed with PARASOL and CALIPSO-GOCCP, b) simulated with LMDZ5B and the simulator over the tropical oceans. The colorbar represents the number of points at each box (cloud fraction - cloud reflectance) divided by the total number of points.
